    <h1>Mood-Based Playlist Generator ðŸŽµ</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my project! This is a Python app that suggests songs based on your mood.</p>
    <p>Type a mood (like "happy" or "sad"), and itâ€™ll suggest a song for you!</p>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> The app uses a dictionary to match moods to songs and a loop to let you try different moods.</p>
    <p><strong>My Favorite Feature:</strong> You can add your own songs to the list!</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/TalarTheCodeWizard/mood-playlist-generator">Check out the code on GitHub and try it yourself!</a></p>
